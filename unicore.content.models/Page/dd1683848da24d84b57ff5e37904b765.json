Because only about a quarter of those infected with cholera show severe symptoms of cholera, three times as many people can be spreading the disease as the number of reported cases. \r\n\r\nCholera is a bacterial disease that causes severe watery diarrhoea, caught from water and food contaminated with faeces.  It can kill quickly through dehydration but rapid re-hydration with ORS saves lives.",
