As with any illness or disease, it is always possible that a person\r\nwho has been exposed to Ebola virus may choose to travel. If the individual\r\nhas not developed symptoms, they cannot transmit Ebola virus to those around\r\nthem. It is however recommended that people minimize non-essential travel to\r\nplaces that have Ebola. If you have recently been to a place or country that\r\nhas confirmed Ebola cases you should be aware of the symptoms of infection and\r\nseek medical attention at the first sign of illness.\r\n\r\n",
